Cons:
- no Street View Library
- Custom Icon for marker may not work
- polygon holes
- map loading random issue - blank? and performance?
- view.extent = layer.fullExtent not working properly - workaround is a bounding box
- GeoJSONLayer requires valid web URL, not supports custom icon


Pros:
- more libraries open for development. e.g. LayerList
- popupTemplate
